# Random Projects
 A few random things I've created over the years. These do not include my school projects for the most part, nor work or proprietary games.

MotionSensor and RedditSearch are the most recent, though they weren't coded with the best standards in mind at the time.
To see a better example of my coding, I can provide some of the proprietary things I've made upon request.

Some these are the incomplete and older versions of what I have currently in-place.
