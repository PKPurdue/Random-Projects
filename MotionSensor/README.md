Majority of code taken from: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/webcam-motion-detector-python/

How it works: It gets access to your computer's webcam, and opens multiple windows displaying the webcam with various effects. When it detects movement, it logs it into an excel file and saves the parts of the image that moved.
My contribution was slightly fixing up and editing the code at the above link and added the functionality to save the movement in the image.
